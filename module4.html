        <p>Based upon the service you have; you need to figure out the best 
            way to explain it. This could be through short sentences, long paragraphs, 
            bullet point sections, or video.If your services are visual, a variety of
             photography/graphics accompanying the content may help put everything together.
             If not, icons with less elaborate imagery may be more suitable.</p>
